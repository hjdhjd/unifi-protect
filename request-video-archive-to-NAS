//Hi team, I found a proxy/api in unifi-protect to archive the recording to the NAS (which I already configured in webUI) and automatically convert to mp4. 
//I discovered it is working with max 1h intervals to process the files. 

//I would like to ask you to implement such option to your package, as my use case is:
//motion detection finished (recording of motion is finished) -> send the recording to the NAS archive ... 
//ideally would be to use AWS-CLI to upload to AWS, but it is not natively supported, so I am using NAS in between

//cheers! and let me know if I can help you with anything more!
